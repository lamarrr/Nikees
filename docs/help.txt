How to use:

'auth' Command:
After obtaining your order number from: {SI} , you need to authorize/validate your account to be able to generate Nike accounts

        {sym} auth [order_number] 


'gen' Command: 
Used to generate accounts after authorization.

        {sym} gen [country_code] gmail [email] [quantity]
        {sym} gen [country_code] catchall [domain] [quantity]
        {sym} gen [country_code] random [quantity]


i.e. let's say I need 20 Nike accounts from United Kingdom using my gmail account as the registration email, I type:
        {sym} gen GB gmail user12345@gmail.com 20

i.e. Let's now say I need to use a random email address instead, I type:
        {sym} gen GB random 22

Let's now say I need to use a catchall domain instead, I type:
        {sym} gen GB catchall mydomain.com 20
